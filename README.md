# Content-Management-System
- I started by running npm installers for the various programs I would need.
- Afterwards I created an index js file and my two sql files.
- The first sql file, schema.sql, was filled with the table information that appeared
in the example on bootcampspot, as was the information that I added into the seeds.sql.
- In the index.js I went through and added an initial inquirer prompt for a main menu,
and then went down the list of required functionalities, adding db.queries and internal 
prompts at the end of a series of if else statements.
- Some of these statements worked initially, but the update information query did not.
- I fussed with it for some time, trying to come up with something that would allow
me to pass whatever new employee data into the inquirer statement, but nothing worked.
- I poured over fullstack posts online, but nothing really could answer my question,
and I had a similar problem with trying to terminate the prompts, where I had to use
control c each time instead of just being able to go back to the main menu or end the prompt
altogether.
- That was a problem no amount of fullstack posts could fix, and I had to settle for the
functionality I already had.
